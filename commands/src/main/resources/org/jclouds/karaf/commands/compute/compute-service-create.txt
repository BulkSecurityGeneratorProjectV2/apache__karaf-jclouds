This command can be used in order to create, configure and register a reusable compute service. 
Even though that each command can create its own compute service, creating a reusable one has the benefit of making command execution faster and simpler (no need to provide provider/api idenetity credentials and options for each command).
You can configure the service by using the options supported by the command or by having the service details configured as environmental variables.
The list of supported variables:

JCLOUDS_COMPUTE_PROVIDER
JCLOUDS_COMPUTE_API
JCLOUDS_COMPUTE_IDENTITY
JCLOUDS_COMPUTE_CREDENTIAL
JCLOUDS_COMPUTE_ENDPOINT

Please note that for provider or api, you can have a single registered service, using this command to configure a service for a provider or api that is already registered, will result in replace the existing service.
You can list the compute services that are already registered, with the jclouds:compute-service-list command and you can destroy a compute service with the jclouds:compute-service-destroy command.
