This command can be used in order to create, configure and register a reusable blobstore service.
Even though that each command can create its own blobstore service, creating a reusable one has the benefit of making command execution faster and simpler (no need to provide provider/api idenetity credentials and options for each command).
You can configure the service by using the options supported by the command or by having the service details configured as environmental variables.
The list of supported variables:

JCLOUDS_BLOBSTORE_PROVIDER
JCLOUDS_BLOBSTORE_API
JCLOUDS_BLOBSTORE_IDENTITY
JCLOUDS_BLOBSTORE_CREDENTIAL
JCLOUDS_BLOBSTORE_ENDPOINT

Please note that for provider or api, you can have a single registered service, using this command to configure a service for a provider or api that is already registered, will result in replace the existing service.
You can list the blobstore services that are already registered, with the jclouds:blobstore-service-list command and you can destroy a blobstore service with the jclouds:blobstore-service-destroy command.
